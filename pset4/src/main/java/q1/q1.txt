1. We have a server that counts the number of people in a given image. We have a request queue where the server would read the requests for people counting from. Multithreading allows for parsing of requests and people counting to take place concurrently.

2. Multithreading could be used to have multiple threads working on counting images at the same time, allowing for more efficient processing of requests.

3. Furthermore, multiple server shards can be used to have multiple request queues that the cameras that take those images would send to, allowing for further parallelisation of the system.
