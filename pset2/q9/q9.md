The total number of paths, just based on the number of branches, is ``3^2 = 9``. The path that would for certain have more than 100 iterations would be the infinite path, where first ``threshold--`` , then ``threshold++``, essentially causing no change in its value and thus being an infinite loop. It would not be counted in the possible paths here. The other paths that are not possible are the paths where the conditions are ``x <= 5`` and ``x > 1000``, which cannot happen at the same time. 

Path 1: ``5 < x <= 1000`` 
Path 2: ``x > 1000 &&  y >= 1``
Path 3: ``x <= 5 && y <= 12``
Path 4: ``x <= 5 && y > 12``
