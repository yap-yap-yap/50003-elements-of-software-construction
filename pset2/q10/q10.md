Condition coverage requires the 'sub-expressions' to be covered. The branches in ``manipulate()`` that have multiple boolean expressions within a branch are when the ``x`` statement is false, which leads to the condition involving ``y``. My branch coverage test cases cover both cases where ``x statement = false , y statement = true`` and ``x statement = false , y statement = false``. The other conditions involving ``x statement = true`` are also covered.  Thus, condition coverage is achieved.
